 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * you can use
 *    require_tree .
 *    require name_of_or_path_to_stylesheet
 *      or
 *    require_self

/*
 * Note that the below is using sass' import feature to manually composite all relevant stylesheets
 * This relies on this application stylesheet having been given the .scss extension instead of .css
