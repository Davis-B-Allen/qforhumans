1D	#ff0000	A♦	A	♦	World		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What do I<br>need to know?	I have no idea what I would do if I didn't do what I do. The question makes no sense to me.
1S	#000000	A♠	A	♠	Work		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What do I want<br>to do?	This is a colossally stupid question. I want to do what needs to be done, and whether what needs to be done is something I want to do is irrelevant.

2S	#000000	2♠	2	♠	Motivation		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What will I do<br>only if<br>I am rewarded and<br>what will I do<br>for its own sake?	If you want to know why I do what I do it is because I was trained to do it and it needs to be done. I don't care about rewards. People who care about rewards can be bought, and I can't be bought.

Trusting others is dangerous; there are a very few people I trust without question because if I doubted their loyalty I couldn't do my job. Change generally is for the worse; I prefer stability, but change does grant me the opportunity to manipulate others because when things change people don't know what the new rules are. Every day carries an element of risk. My days might be riskier than yours, but being alive carries risk.

7C	#000000	7♣	7	♣	War vs. Peace		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	How will I<br>be good when<br>everyone else<br>is evil?	I trust that my country and my people are good and I worry about whenever everyone else is being evil.
7D	#ff0000	7♦	7	♦	Knowing vs. Doing		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	How might I<br>benefit from<br>more knowledge<br>and when will I<br>know enough<br>to act?	I try my best to learn everything I need to know before I need to know it, but in my line of work, when it is time to act there is no time to do anything but act.

7S	#000000	7♠	7	♠	Now vs. Later		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What rewards can<br>I put off until later<br>so I can concentrate<br>on doing my<br>best work now?

8D	#ff0000	8♦	8	♦	Economy		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	Do I have<br>what I need<br>for the future?	I wish you hadn't asked me that because now I realize I don't have something to do in the years between when I'm too old to do what I do and when I die.
8S	#000000	8♠	8	♠	Power		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	When do I need<br>more power<br>and why?	When my enimies are more powerful then I need to become more powerful in order to defeat them.

TD	#ff0000	10♦	10	♦	Loving Life		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What gets me up<br>every morning?	What a stupid question. It's what you do each day, you get up and do what needs to be done.
TS	#000000	10♠	10	♠	Love of the Work		#ffffff	#000000	#cccccc	What do I love<br>to do?	I love the chase; the game; the excitement; and the women.
